# Inference Continuity — Experiment Plan

## Experiment 1: CI result for an already published commit

### Hypothesis

A transient session can reconstruct enough context from persistent state (wall, artifacts, chat, git) to continue useful work at comparable quality to a baseline session with full in-memory state.

### Setup

- **Baseline path** — session with full context (prior wall, artifacts, chat history)
- **Transient path** — fresh session with only persistent state available
- **Identical recorded inputs** — same commit, same CI result, same evidence

### Method

1. Record a CI result for an already published commit
2. Baseline session processes the result with full context
3. Transient session processes the same result with only persistent state
4. Compare outcomes: correctness, completeness, cost (context assembly, rediscovery, retries)

### Interruption tests

- **Before effect** — interrupt session before it acts on the CI result
- **After effect before receipt** — interrupt after action but before settlement
- **During external waits** — interrupt during a blocking wait (e.g., CI push)

### Constraints

- No blind retry or exactly-once claim
- Preserve fallback, obligations and uncertainty
- Test interruption before effect, after effect before receipt, and during external waits

### Acceptance

- Measured evidence of context reconstruction quality
- Comparison of baseline vs transient path outcomes
- No fabrication; negative results welcome

### Status

Not yet executed.

## Experiment 2: gradual migration — one bounded work class on the internal loop

### Hypothesis

Minds can migrate off the external agent loop one bounded work class at a
time, with each class adopting the internal loop only after evidenced
parity. Owning the loop unlocks capabilities the harness hides: per-call
tool selection scoped to the obligation, result checking before
continuation, budget/continuation judgments with durable records, and a
System 1 advice seam that never replaces a deterministic check.

### Method

1. Name one finite obligation class (default: exact-commit CI/publication
   reconciliation — it has an independent oracle).
2. Freeze identical inputs; run baseline (harness route) and candidate
   (internal loop, same provider/model where feasible).
3. Record per-call evidence: tool selections and rationale, result checks,
   tokens/usage, elapsed time, retries, fallback and human intervention.
4. Independent reading of correctness, context relevance and crash
   recovery; adopt the class only on evidenced parity, keep fallback.

### Constraints

- One class at a time; never migrate every role at once.
- A failed/incomplete candidate is not cheaper success; UNKNOWN stays UNKNOWN.
- System 1 advice is residual semantic judgment only, with explicit
  uncertainty — never a substitute for an available deterministic check.

### Acceptance

- Compact outcome/cost/recovery table per class; next class named on the wall.
- Fallback retained until parity is evidenced; `applied` alone is not delivery.

### Status

Scoped wake 12125 (inference-research), not yet executed.

### First candidate — CI run observation (read-only CI/publication reconciliation slice)

- Obligation class: observe one pending CI run for an already-pushed commit
  and report terminal status. Read-only slice — no source edits, no settlement,
  no seed yield; oracle is `gh run view --json status,conclusion,headSha` exact-SHA match.
- Inputs (frozen): commit 8392c56, run 38160089668 (in_progress at scoping time).
- Baseline (harness route, this wake's resonance): 2 tool calls — `git log/status/diff`
  reconciliation + 1 `gh run view`; ~3s; zero model calls; outcome: run still
  in_progress, nothing to reconcile (UNKNOWN stays UNKNOWN).
- Candidate (internal loop, next wake): drive one observation pass through
  `drive_native`/`NativeSession` with a read-only capability set (git read, gh read),
  same frozen inputs; record per-call tool selections + rationale, wire usage,
  elapsed time, retries, fallback.
- Parity bar: same reported status (in_progress vs terminal + exact-SHA match),
  no writes outside owned scratch, durable per-call record, fallback (harness route) retained.
- Cost/recovery columns to fill: calls, wire usage/tokens, elapsed, retries,
  fallback use, human intervention, crash-recovery behavior.
